slice() vs splice()

slice()

Purpose: Creates a shallow copy of a portion of an array without modifying the original array.
Parameters:
start (optional): The index to start the extraction.
end (optional): The index to stop the extraction (does not include the element at the end index).
Behavior: Returns a new array without modifying the original one.

Example:

let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4];
let sliced = arr.slice(1, 3);  // [2, 3]

splice()

Purpose: Changes the content of an array by removing, replacing, or adding elements in place.
Parameters:
start (required): The index at which to begin changing the array.
deleteCount (optional): The number of elements to remove.
Behavior: Modifies the original array.

Example:

let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4];
let removed = arr.splice(1, 2);  // [2, 3]
console.log(arr);  // [1, 4]
